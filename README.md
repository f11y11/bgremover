# Bulk Background Remover
Built using Python & PIL.

### Use Cases:
- Replacing #FFF pixels with transparent ones
- Nothing else.

### Notes:
- This is not a reliable application, it only replaces the fully white pixels without doing any checks
- This will work properly as long as you have pictures with fully white background to remove
- Supported file types are JPG, JPEG and PNG. Saved files will be converted to PNG to keep the transparency.
- Results will be saved inside the results folder. The folder will be automatically created if not exists.
- #### **This project is created to show how to make operations on each pixel for those who need**
